# CEQ-INPE

This is CEQ-INPE, a software to find thermodynamics data and number of moles from combustion reaction of the type CHON for problems such as: constant entalpy 
and pressure (HP), constant temperature and pressure (TP), constant internal energy and volume (UV) and constant temperature and volume (TV).

Made by Jos√© Raimundo da Silva Junior (FEG-UNESP, SP-Brazil)
Advised by Dr. Fernando de Souza Costa (INPE-LCP, SP-Brazil)

The file CEQ-INPE.rar constains three python files: NasaGlennCoefficients.py, EquillibriumReaction.py and CEQ-INPE. The fist file contains the thermodynamics dataset
from NASA report "NASA Glenn Coefficients for Calculating  Thermodynamic  Properties  of  Individual  Species, 2002", the second file is the math model to solve the
chemical equation and output the information required and the third file is a GUI application to be used by everyone.

To run the program the following libraries are required:

numpy, matplotlib, scypi and pillow.
